**Projects**

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- [Around the U.S.](https://melvar1.github.io/se_project_aroundtheus/): This project is a webpage created using HTML and CSS, with a primary focus on responsive layout design and the implementation of CSS Grid. It serves as an example of a social media profile, complete with a person's profile information, edit buttons, and a responsive grid displaying photos and their descriptions.

- [Coffee Shop Landing Page](https://melvar1.github.io/se_project_coffeeshop/): This project is a simple, yet elegant website designed for a virtual coffee shop.
